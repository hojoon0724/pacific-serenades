        <p>A Message from Mark Carlson About Pacific Serenades</p>
        <p>
          When I was finishing up as a grad student in composition at UCLA in the early 80s—and already a professional
          flutist—I recognized that many composers in Los Angeles were writing a very different kind of music than those
          on the upper East Coast, which everyone assumed then was the center of the country’s classical music world. I
          also realized that the repertoire of classical music is virtually made up entirely of pieces that were written
          for specific occasions. Out of this came the idea for Pacific Serenades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why not create a platform for which local composers would be given the opportunity to write the kind of music
          they wanted to write—music in which melody and tonality still played a major role, music freely created out of
          any number of styles and influences? All the better if it were presented in the context of standard chamber
          music repertoire played by wonderful local musicians!
        </p>
        <p>
          And that’s what Pacific Serenades did from its first concert in 1982 through its last in 2016, during which
          time 113 new works were commissioned and premiered.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am thrilled and honored to pass the torch of Pacific Serenades to my friend and colleague Jeff Kryka so its
          mission can continue to live on!
        </p>
