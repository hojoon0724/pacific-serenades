        <p>Dear Friends & Fellow Music Lovers</p>
        <p>
          My name is Jeff Kryka, I’m a composer and UCLA alum (MA 2008, PhD 2011) and currently serving on the UCLA
          School of Music Alumni Board. I had the great pleasure of working alongside Mark Carlson at UCLA and attending
          MANY Pacific Serenades concerts, as well as writing a commission for the organization in 2009. I’ve always
          admired Mark’s unwavering dedication to the promotion of new music through his many years with Pacific
          Serenades. His mission, along with that of the organization, to present new music as an integral part of our
          living musical tradition resonates deeply with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am excited to announce, with Mark’s blessing, that we have relaunched Pacific Serenades, beginning with our
          inaugural concert in the fall of 2024. Our guiding vision is to continue the organization’s legacy of
          performing newly commissioned works alongside established chamber music repertoire. I look forward to this new
          chapter with our audiences and bringing beautiful music to life together.
        </p>
