        <p>Dear Friends & Fellow Music Lovers,</p>
        <p>
          My name is Jeff Kryka, I’m a composer and UCLA alum (MA 2008, PhD 2011) and currently serving on the UCLA
          School of Music Alumni Board. I had the great pleasure of working alongside Mark Carlson at UCLA and attending
          MANY Pacific Serenades concerts, as well as writing a commission for the organization in 2009. I’ve always
          admired Mark’s unwavering dedication to the promotion of new music through his many years with Pacific
          Serenades. His mission, along with that of the organization, to present new music as an integral part of our
          living musical tradition resonates deeply with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am excited to announce, with Mark’s blessing, that we are relaunching Pacific Serenades this fall, and
          planning to continue its legacy of performances of newly commissioned music alongside established chamber
          music repertoire. Our inaugural concert will be presented as a special event hosted by Steinway & Sons at the
          Colburn School on the evening of Friday October 18th at 8pm.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concert will feature piano duet music newly composed and arranged by myself and performed by the pianists
          of Duo Amal (the fabulous Bishara Haroni & Yaron Kohlberg) utilizing Steinway’s unique Spirio system.
        </p>
        <p>
          To read more about the concert and to RSVP please see the link below. The event is free but an RSVP is
          required.

          Pacific Serenades concerts in the coming weeks.
