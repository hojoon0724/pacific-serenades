    "bio": "<p>A graduate of UCLA in music and the child of European trained professional violinists, I began studying the piano at age 4 and composition at 10. I had the good fortune to have had great teachers: for piano, Jacob Gimpel and Aube Tzerko in Los Angeles, Joanna Graudan at the Aspen Music School and early composition studies with Saul Kaplan and Leonard Stein. After enjoying a lengthy hiatus performing other people?s music, I returned to studying composition with Stephen ?Lucky? Mosko at CalArts and orchestration with Albert Harris.</p>\n<p>Music has always been a central part of my life. Whether it has been performing, singing, or composing, it is the thread that weaves through each part of my being. I find joy in every form of music, and my life has been an eclectic patchwork of music ranging from avant- garde 20th century vocal and choral music to Baroque, ethnic, folk music, jazz, popular, and of course, classical music. We are each an amalgam of our pasts, influenced by our individual experiences, and I have been extremely fortunate in having an extraordinary past which informs my present and makes me look forward with great enthusiasm to the future..</p>"
