Commissioned by Carnegie Hall, Karpman’s multimedia opera ASK YOUR MAMA, written for Jessye Norman, The Roots, jazz singer, and orchestra, on a text by Langston Hughes, premiered to critical acclaim. Karpman was named one of the most important women in Hollywood by Variety Magazine. She received her doctorate from The Juilliard School where she studied music composition with Milton Babbitt, and is a professor with a joint appointment in the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television and School of Music.</p>"
