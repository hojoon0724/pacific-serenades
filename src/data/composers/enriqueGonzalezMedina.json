He recently finished his Concertino íntimo, for piano and small orchestra, a commission by the Baja California Orchestra, scheduled to be premiered in 2008. In 2006 he concluded and premiered the composition of the Baja California Songbook, a song collection of twenty-five settings of poems by five Baja California poets. Among his recent works, his children’s opera How Nanita Learned to Make Flan, a 2003 commission by Cincinnati Opera, has had over one hundred and fifty performances in the United States. He was also commissioned to compose the quartet Concierto barroco by Pacific Serenades. This same ensemble selected this work for their upcoming CD Border Crossings (2007). In 2002, the guitarist Felix Bullock premiered his guitar concerto Medellin Concerto in Colombia, and the Mexican duo of soprano Claudia Montiel and guitarist Carlos Bernal recorded his song cycle The Teacher’s Verses for their CD La Cuerda del Tiempo on the Quindecim Recordings label (Mexico). Enrique Gonzalez-Medina studied composition in Mexico City attending the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), and in the United States, he graduated from The Mannes College of Music (B.M.) and CSLA (M.M.). Since 1997 he is a member of the piano faculty of the Pasadena Conservatory of Music.
