By the age of 15, jazz had become part of John’s identity as he attended the Los Angeles Music Magnet, Hamilton High School Academy of the Arts, from 1989 to 1991. After high school, he attended UCLA, studying with classical trumpet virtuosi Mario Guarneri and Malcolm McNab. Although John’s musical interests were firmly placed in jazz (playing trumpet and electric bass in the UCLA jazz bands), he pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree with a concentration in classical composition. During that time, John won the Herb Alpert Award, David Joel Miller Award, National Trumpet Competition, and the ITG Jazz Soloist Competition.</p>"

He began formal musical training at around 5 or 6 years of age by studying piano, clarinet, and bongo drums. At age 11, jazz great Benny Carter, a family friend, gave him a trumpet. Leslie decided at age 15 that he wanted to be a professional musician when he joined a local youth band. Through his association with the youth band he was taught arranging, composing, and music preparation skills. Upon graduating from Los Angeles High School, he attended L. A. Valley College and later transferred to CSULA where he earned a BA in Music Education. During his college years, Leslie began his professional music career by playing and writing for local R & B bands, big bands, and also as a seminal member of the group, Earth, Wind, and Fire. During these early years, Leslie began to formulate his own compositional ideas and began composing and rehearsing his own musical aggregations.</p>"
